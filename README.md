# PVP Biome Dominions

PVP Biome Dominions is a mod that allows creating rules for:
- PVP control
- Position sharing management

based on the current biome of the player. You can apply different combat rules to Meadows, Black Forest, etc even for Ocean!

## Usage instructions

Generate the configuration file "Turbero.PvPBiomeDominions.cfg" that will be created once the mod is executed for first time. Then, edit the file or use a ConfigurationManager mod to apply the rules to each biome.

### -- PvP Settings Configuration --

Here you can find each existing biome in the game to configure the pvp rule to apply:

* Pvp: Enforced that players can kill players
* Pve: Enforced that players cannot kill players
* Player Choose: Players decide if they can get killed by other players or not

On the other hand, Wards areas take priority and override the biome rule:

* Pvp: Enforced that players can kill players
* Pve: Enforced that players cannot kill players
* Player Choose: Players decide if they can get killed by other players or not
* Follow Biome Rule: players can kill players only if the biome rule allows it

Alternatively, admins can bypass these rules if the check is On.
